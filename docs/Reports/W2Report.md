# W2 Report

The W2 Report from the [Reports](Reports.md) menu shows a summary of all [Categories](../Basics/Categories.md) that have an associated Tax Category.

The following is an example of what you might see if you setup Tax Categories in each of these areas:

The first row shown here shows up because there are transactions in 2016 marked with a category that has the 1040 Fed. Estimated tax category as follows:

Sometimes an estimated tax payment happens in the wrong year.  For example, the Jan 15th quarterly payment might be for the previous tax year.  If you have this problem you can right click the offending transaction and select "Set Tax Year…" and you will see this dialog:

Set the tax year for this transaction to the previous year, then re-run the W2 report and it will be correctly counted in the tax year you selected.
