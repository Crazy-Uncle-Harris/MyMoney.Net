# Networth Report

To get a report on Net Worth select the Net Worth item under the Reports menu and you will see something like this:

This report summarizes the current value of all your holdings and subtracts credit card balances, and any loans to provide a net worth total.

You can also create [Asset](../Accounts/Assets.md) accounts to cover the value of personal property so those show up in the report also.Â  Just set the Account Type to "Asset" in the Account properties dialog.
