# Trend Graph

Most accounts can show a graph of the balance of that account over time.

The **Trends**  chart shows the balance of the selected transactions over time.    As you move the mouse a pointer follows showing the balance at that date.   If you click the left mouse button it will scroll to that transaction in your transaction view. 

You can also right click on this view and change the timeframe or add another series:

For example, you could pick "Year To Date", then Add Series to compare 2017 and 2018 trends.

The mouse will move over the "selected chart" - you can change the selection by clicking on the item in the legend.

The Export button will export the current graph data to a .csv file and open it, if you have Excel installed you will see it open in Excel.
