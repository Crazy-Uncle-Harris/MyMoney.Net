# Stock Chart

When you select the "View by Security" view you will get an additional tab labelled "Stock" which will show the complete stock price history for that security.  This will only happen if you have setup your [Stock Quote Services](../Accounts/StockQuoteServices.md).

Note: This graph takes stock splits into account, so if you see a graph with a vertical decline like this:

Then chances are you are missing Stock Split information on that date.  See [Securities](../Basics/Securities.md) on how to provide stock split information.

Note this is a type of [Trend Graph](TrendGraph.md) so the same context menu items are available here.
