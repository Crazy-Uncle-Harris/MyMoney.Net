There are several ways to navigate between different views, and MyMoney keeps a history of the views you have visited .  You can navigate back and forwards through that view history using these buttons at the top left:

Like any good web browser you can also use ALT-LEFT for Back and and ALT-RIGHT for Forward navigation.

You can pivot to new transaction sets using the following commands on the transaction view context menu:

### Goto related transaction (F12)
navigate between each end of a Transfer.  This can also prompt to create a transfer if it finds a matching
transaction in another account.

### View Transactions by Account (F8)
show all transactions in the same Account as the selected transaction

### View Transactions by Category (F7)
show all transactions with the same Category  as the selected transaction

### View Transactions by Payee (F6)
show all transactions with the same Payee as the selected transaction

### View Transactions by Security (F5)
show all investment transactions with the same Security

You can also navigate using the Categories panel, the Payees panel or by selecting parts of a chart or report.
