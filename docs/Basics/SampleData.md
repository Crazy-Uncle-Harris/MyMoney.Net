# Sample Data

After creating a new empty database the following Help menu item can be used to populate some sample data:

This will create a few accounts, and enter a bunch of transactions, populate sample categories, and even enter stock trades.Â  This allows you to get an idea of how the app works and lets you see the various charts and reports.

Once completed you should see something like this:

You can create your own sample data template using "Export Sample Data" which generates a histogram from your real data which can then be used in creating other sample data sets more similar to yours, but randomly generated so as to protect your confidentiality.

You can choose to save or not to save this sample database by just closing the window.
