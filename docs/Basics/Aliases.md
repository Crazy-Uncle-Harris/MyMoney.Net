# Aliases

When you rename a payee and select the "**Auto-Rename** " checkbox in the Payee Rename dialog, then you are creating an "**Alias** " for that Payee.  Aliases are important for [Auto-Categorization](AutoCategorization.md) to work nicely.  Aliases make it possible for newly downloaded transactions to automatically pick up the nice name you prefer for a given Payee.

You can manage all your Aliases using the **View/Aliases**  menu item:

If you delete a row from this list, it will not "undo" the rename, it will simply remove the alias so that future auto-renames no longer take place.
