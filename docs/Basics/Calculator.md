# Calculator

On most numeric fields within the MyMoney application you can type in a mathematic expression and as soon as it sees you do that a calculator will popup automatically.  For example, in the following field I have entered the expression (1500 * 9.5)/12.

Now when I type ENTER or EQUALS it replaces the expression with the answer, in this case: $1187.50.

It will then forget the expression so no, it is not a Spreadsheet application :-)
