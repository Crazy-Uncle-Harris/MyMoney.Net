# Keyboard Interface

The **MyMoney**  application has several handy keyboard shorts that you can remember to help you get around more efficiently.

### F12
When you select a "Transfer" transaction, F12 jumps you to the other side of the transfer.  F12 again will bring you back.  See [Transfers](Transfers.md).

### ENTER
When editing transactions, the ENTER key will "Commit" the current row and move you to the next row.  Type ENTER again and it will put the next row in edit mode on the same field you were on with the previous row.  So if you need to change a specific field (e.g. Sales Tax) for a bunch of transactions the ENTER key makes that really easy.


### CTRL+ENTER
This action will auto-populate an empty category, accept the transaction and move to the next transaction.  This makes accepting a bunch of new transactions and giving them each their default category a very efficient operation.

### F1
Brings up the Help pages.

### F3
Lookup the selected Payee name on the web.

### F6
While editing [Splits](Splits.md) this key will set the Amount of the current row such that the split balances and there is no unassigned amount.

### TAB
When entering a row the TAB key will take you through each field in the row. 

### SHIFT-TAB
Takes you to the previous field.

### INSERT
Adds a new row with the same date as the selected row.   This is often more convenient than having to scroll to the bottom of the list to add a new row.

### CTRL+P
When on the Payee field this jumps you to the Payment field and vice versa.

### CTRL+SPACE
Toggles the Accept field on the selected row.  During [Balancing Accounts](../Accounts/BalancingAccounts.md) this also "reconciles" the selected row.  So if your bank statement is in the same order you can often very quickly CTRL+SPACE through your transactions and balance your account in a few seconds.

### ALT-LEFT
Back button navigation

### ALT-RIGHT
Forward button navigation
