# CSV Importing

Some banks do not support OFX or QIF interchange formats (which really sucks), for example
Discover card only provides a .csv download.

To import CSV (comma separated value) data into Money you can right click the account
in the Accounts View and select `Import Csv...`.  This will prompt for a local file containing
the CSV data (usually these files contain a .csv file extension).

Here's an example of what that .csv data might look like if you load it into Notepad:

```
Trans. Date,Post Date,Description,Amount,Category
10/25/2022,10/26/2022,"AMAZON.COM AMZN.COM/BILLWA1VK3XV7LNTQ",-9.04,"Payments and Credits"
10/24/2022,10/24/2022,"PRIME VIDEO *H86AC1J92 888-802-3080 WA36ZXXX7TXB9",2.51,"Merchandise"
10/23/2022,10/23/2022,"APPLE.COM/BILL 866-712-7753 CAMML0Z2HTZ5A0",5.42,"Merchandise"
10/23/2022,10/23/2022,"HLU*HULU 375513011660-U HULU.COM/BILLCAHLU*HULU 375513011660-U",16.56,"Services"
10/21/2022,10/21/2022,"PAYMENT - THANK YOU",-1607.22,"Payments and Credits"
10/21/2022,10/21/2022,"THE HOME DEPOT #4712 BOTHELL WA",13.21,"Home Improvement"
10/02/2022,10/02/2022,"STARBUCKS 800-782-7282 SEATTLE WA",50.00,"Restaurants"
```

When you select this file a dialog will appear where you can specify how to map the columns
found in this file with the fields of the Money Transactions as follows:

![CsvImportMap](../Images/CsvImportMap.png)

This map will be saved in the same folder as your Money database under a new folder named `CsvMaps`
so you will not have to keep re-entering this mapping information (unless the columns are changed by your bank).
