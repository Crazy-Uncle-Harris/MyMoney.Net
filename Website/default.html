            yourself. For banks that don't support OFX, you can download Money or Quicken QFX files and import them.

               Basic support for budgeting so you can set monthly goals for each
               category, then it provides a budget balancing feature where you can manually
               transfer money between categories, essentially treating your categories like
               mini bank accounts.  This provides a flexibility in budgeting that makes
               the system more realistic and less rigid and therefore more likely to be used
               long term.

                Tax Categories can be assigned so that you can export your tax information to Turbo Tax.

            Quick Search gives you a powerful ability to find anything in many years of historical data almost instantly.  
            For example, type <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">(costco or arco) and fuel</span> to find all transactions recoding a fuel purchase from either costco or arco.

                Attachments can be associated with each transaction which is handy for tracking
                additional information that doesn't fit in the memo field.  You can also use this
                to store a scanned copy of your store receipts so you can find your receipts 
                quickly and easily.

               Every numeric field in the application pops up a calculator so you can enter 
               expressions to compute the value you want in that field.  This saves you from
               having to switch between applications and makes entering data much more efficient.

                For example, one developer added support for managing rental properties and 
                loans while another added support for easily tracking sales tax.

                Multiple currencies.  When you setup an account you can specify the
                currency used by that account.  This is handy if you have overseas accounts.  It
                is then able to handle the fact that transfers between accounts with different currencies
                will not necessarily have the same amount on either side of those transfers.
